    <p class = "aboutTXT"> 
Adeola John Asimolowo (he/him), also known as “Ade”. I am a patient, generous, and determined person aspiring to grow my career in the computer science field. 
I am a third-year Computer Science Major at the Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences in New Brunswick, NJ. 
       
Currently, I am looking for internships, co-ops, and opportunities of such to learn beyond the classroom and to establish myself in the CS industry. 
       
Apart from my academic studies, I am an active member of the RU Cloud Computing Club aiding me in honing my skills and learning new ones regarding cloud services. 
A hobby of mine is to help those in need by working with the Monat Charity Organization, which assists homeless people with food and clothing donations.
