            <p id="ph1Para">So my cloud journey begins! Phase 1 started off by creating a simple webpage and making it look fancy with HTML/CSS/JS. Prior to taking on this challenge, I had little to no experience with those 3 languages. 
                                The resources I used heavily were Youtube, ChatGPT, and looking at other websites so I could quickly pick up the syntax, mostly for CSS as it was finicky to use</p>

                In terms of the AWS Services used, I first learned about Amazon S3 which would allow me to store my webpage files. It is a service that allows for secured storage of data on a large scale. Next, I would need to use AWS Route 53 in order to buy my custom domain name you see in the search bar (adeolainthecloud.com). Simply put Route 53 is a managed DNS (Domain Name System) which stores the collection of rules and records of domains that help clients understand how to reach a server through URLs. Lastly, to increase the speeds of the web page response time, and make it more secure I used a CloudFront Distribution. CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that significantly improves the read performance by using edge location caching. With that being said, let's host my website!

            <li id= "ph1Para">Put my files into an S3 Bucket and adjust the policies so that it can be publicly accessible.  </li>
            <li id= "ph1Para">After purchasing my domain on route 53, I would need to get it certified it with the Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) </li>
                 <ul>
                    <li id= "ph1Para" >When a user connects to a webpage, the webpage will send over its SSL certificate which contains the public key necessary to start the secure session.
                        The two computers, the client and the server, then go through a process called an SSL/TLS handshake, which is a series of back-and-forth communications used to establish a secure connection.  </li>
                    </li>
                 </ul>
            <li> Create my CloudFront distribution which points to my S3 bucket, it would also ensure that viewers access the website through HTTPS.
            </li>
            <li>Connect my domain name which is now certified to my CloudFront distribution.  </li>
            </ul>
