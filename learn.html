            <p id="ph1Para">So my cloud journey begins! Phase 1 started off by creating a simple webpage and making it look fancy with HTML/CSS/JS. Prior to taking on this challenge, I had little to no experience with those 3 languages. 
                                The resources I used heavily were Youtube, ChatGPT, and looking at other websites so I could quickly pick up the syntax, mostly for CSS as it was finicky to use</p>

            <p class="subscript-text" style="font-size: smaller;"><i>  (HTML) & (CSS) </i></p>
            
            <p id="ph1Para">
                In terms of the AWS Services used, I first learned about Amazon S3 which would allow me to store my webpage files. It is a service that allows for secured storage of data on a large scale. Next, I would need to use AWS Route 53 in order to buy my custom domain name you see in the search bar (adeolainthecloud.com). Simply put Route 53 is a managed DNS (Domain Name System) which stores the collection of rules and records of domains that help clients understand how to reach a server through URLs. Lastly, to increase the speeds of the web page response time, and make it more secure I used a CloudFront Distribution. CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that significantly improves the read performance by using edge location caching. With that being said, let's host my website!
